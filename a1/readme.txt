The Running Jason ____ Yiran Mao ____260850827

My character is named 'Jason'.
His root is a free joint, which helps me to display him from any angle.
And his two shoulders are ball-joints, as well as his hips, wrists and ankles. While his knees and elbows are hint-joints.
I used two colors: gold and silver, to paint the character. I made him a running pose and a running animation.


The character is built in character.xml; The animation is built in character-keyposes.javabin. Both of them are in the folder "a1data".
Also, I recorded a picture of pose(Running.png) and a movie of animation(a mp4 file) in the folder "stills".
